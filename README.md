# 🚀 Personal Portfolio | Mohammed Raushan Hussain

A high-performance, responsive personal portfolio built with a focus on modern CSS techniques, "Cyber-tech" aesthetics, and a clean user experience. This project serves as a central hub for my technical journey, open-source contributions, and future career goals.

## 🛠️ Features & Technical Highlights

- **Animated Gradient Borders**: Implemented using CSS Houdini (`@property`) and conic-gradients to create a seamless "spinning light" effect.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: High-contrast, semi-transparent containers with `backdrop-filter: blur()` for a premium dark-mode feel.
- **Responsive Design**: Fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using modern CSS Flexbox.
- **Custom Interaction**: Integrated custom SVG-based cursors and smooth transition states for an immersive user experience.
- **Modular Structure**: Separated concerns with dedicated stylesheets for the landing page (`portfolio.css`) and sub-pages (`sub-port.css`).
